# TwentyCities
An app that returns the 20 twenties, chosen based on distance to the user-entered lat, lng, and population of the city, given by a file of data, US.txt.
The US.txt is converted to US.json file for parsing.  The cities are chosen based on a constraining metric.  User can clear the lat, lng and enter new search data.
